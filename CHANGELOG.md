# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Repo created. Ads Integration wizard moved in from `Monetization-SDK-Unity`'s
  `Assets/MeticaIntegrationTool/`, repackaged as `com.gamedistrict.metica-integration-tools`.
  - `MeticaPaths.ToolRoot` now resolves via `PackageManager.PackageInfo.FindForAssembly`
    instead of scanning `Assets/` — required once the tool no longer lives there.
  - Target SDK version pinning now reads a per-project override
    (`Assets/MeticaIntegrationToolsSettings/MeticaTargetVersion.asset`) if the project has
    created one, falling back to the packaged default — a shared, often-read-only package
    install is the wrong place to hand-edit a per-project setting.
  - `RemoveToolStep` now removes the package via `Client.Remove(...)` (Package Manager)
    instead of `AssetDatabase.DeleteAsset` on its own folder — the old approach only made
    sense when the tool was a plain Assets folder.
  - `GradleVersionStep`, `KotlinTemplateStep`, `GradleTemplateEditor` moved to
    `Editor/Shared/Gradle/` — shared with the Genre Creator flow once it lands, so only one
    place owns `baseProjectTemplate.gradle`.
- Genre Creator (from `gd-analytics-genre-creator`) not yet moved in.
